Project 1 Odin

This project is a crash course in basic HTML styling. 
Using information learned from Project Odin up until this point I have created a website with linking pages that contain the following elements:
1. Links to outside websites
2. Links to internal webpages
3. Images
4. Ordered and unorderd lists
5. Headers
6. Paragraphs
